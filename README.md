# Demo

## Start the web
* To start the web make sure to run `demo_ai.py` with python as a normal python file instead of using Flask as a module. So `python demo/demo_ai.py` and not `python -m flask run`. 
* `Upload Data` is yet not implemented.
* The AI is now integrated with the website, however it re-trains itself every time the webserver is restarted.
* The AI has loadable and saveable weights. You'll find those weights under `demo/ai_data` named `weights.h5` and/or `weights_prel.h5`. If `weights.h5` exists it will attempt to use those weights, otherwise it will retrain itself and save the weights as `weights_prel.h5`. It is your job as a user to change the name to `weights.h5` in order to make sure they're used the next time the server restarts.
